# libchart

This directory is a [Helm library chart](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/library_charts/)

It contains the templates used by the application's Helm Charts.

It's a way to reuse code across different charts, reducing code duplication.

NOTE: Template names should start with underscore ("_") and to have the ".tpl" extension.
